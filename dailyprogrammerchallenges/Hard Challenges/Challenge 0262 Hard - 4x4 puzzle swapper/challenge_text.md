# Description

You have a 4x4 grid containing pieces numbered 1 to 16, of which you choose the order. To move the pieces you swap the positions of 2 pieces (this is not a slider puzzle - there's no open space).  Tiles must be swapped with adjacent tiles. The goal to to solve the puzzle in as few moves as possible, showing all steps. The steps are which 2 pieces swap positions for each move. Pieces could be referred to by their position or their number.

**Input #1**



4 6 2 14

15 8 13 1

10 5 9 12

7 11 16 3

**the solved puzzle is:**

1 2 3 4

5 6 7 8

9 10 11 12

13 14 15 16

It may be too hard to guarantee a solution in the fewest possible moves.  You may instead use a strategy that is quick enough, if you want.
