#Description:

So I was working on coming up with a specific challenge that had us some how using an API or custom code to mine information off a specific website and so forth.

I found myself spending lots of time researching the "design" for the challenge. You had to implement it. It occured to me that one of the biggest "challenges" in software and programming is coming up with a "design".


So for this challenge you will be given lots of room to do what you want. I will just give you a problem to solve. How and what you do depends on what you pick. This is more a project based challenge.

#Requirements

* You must get data from a website. Any data. Game websites. Wikipedia. Reddit. Twitter. Census or similar data.

* You read in this data and generate an analysis of it. For example maybe you get player statistics from a sport like Soccer, Baseball, whatever. And find the top players or top statistics. Or you find a trend like age of players over 5 years of how they perform better or worse.

* Display or show your results. Can be text. Can be graphical. If you need ideas - check out http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful great examples of how people mine data for showing some cool relationships.
