Travelling Salesman problem.

There are N cities numbered from 0..N-1. A salesman is located at city 0. He wishes to visit all cities exactly once and return back to city 0. There are K toll booths. Each toll booth has a certain range of functioning. The parameters for toll k are given as x_k and y_k. If the salesman travels from city i to j, he has to pay 1 dollar toll fee to each toll p having x_p >= i and y_p <= j. Calculate the cheapest way for the salesman to complete his tour.

Input :

The first line contains T the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two space seperated integers N and K. Each of the next K lines contains 2 integers, the ith line containing x_i and y_i (0 <= x_i,y_i < N). A blank line seperates two test cases.

Output :

Output T lines, one for each test case, containing the required answer.


Edit: Also since some people have problems, here are two solutions .. just see it for reference!  [link1](http://pastebin.com/j7aMRj8M)  [link2](http://pastebin.com/FgVSZYYF)
