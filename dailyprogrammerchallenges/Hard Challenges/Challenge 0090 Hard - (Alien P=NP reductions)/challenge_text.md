Ancient aliens have come down from earth and announced that, clearly, P=NP, and they've been trying to explain it to us for years.  Something about it being encoded in the pyramids they helped us build...or...something.

In order to help human scientific progress, the aliens have begun distributing crystal alien technology nodes that are oracle solutions to NP-complete problems.  Despite being very strange looking, they have USB cable ports and provide an API for all human computer languages and operating systems.  This API provides a single 
function "alien_knapsack()" which takes in an instance of the knapsack problem and immediately returns the solution (it uses alient time-travel technology or something).

Write a program demonstrating how you can solve your favorite NP-complete problem by calling "alien_knapsack" as a black-box.  You can pick any problem you want and show how to reduce it to an instance of the knapsack problem.  If you are finding your code difficult to test, then see the bonus problem.

BONUS:  Write an implementation of the alien_knapsack() function in a human programming language.  Obviously this does not have to be a polynomial-time solution.
