**Description:**

You are a proud explorer, walking towards a range of mountains. These mountains, as they appear to you, are a series of isosceles triangles all clustered on the horizon. [Check out this example image](http://imgur.com/a/lyhMt), sketched by your awesome aid nint22 (smiling-mountain not important). Your goal, given the position of the base of these triangles, how tall they are, and their base-width, is to compute the overall unique area. Note that you should not count areas that have overlapping mountains - you only care about what you can see (i.e. only count the purple areas once in the [example image](http://imgur.com/a/lyhMt)).

**Formal Inputs & Outputs:**

*Input Description:*

Integer n - The number of triangles

Array of triangles T - An array of triangles, where each triangle has a position (float x), a base-length (float width), and a triangle-height (float height).

*Output Description:*

Print the area of the triangles you see (without measuring overlap more than once), accurate to the second decimal digit.

**Sample Inputs & Outputs:**

Todo... will have to solve this myself (which is pretty dang hard).

**Notes:**

It is critically important to NOT count overlapped triangle areas more than once. Again, only count the purple areas once in the [example image](http://imgur.com/a/lyhMt)..
