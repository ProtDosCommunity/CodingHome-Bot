#Theme Week:

We conclude this theme week with our final challenge. Those keeping up with the challenges will find this one easier than normal for a hard as you can use your solutions from the Easy and Intermediate to help you.

Those new to this one please see these challenges

* [Part 1] (http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/23lfrf/4212014_challenge_159_easy_rock_paper_scissors/)
* [Part 2] (http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/23qy19/4232014_challenge_159_intermediate_rock_paper/)

#Description:

Monday we used random pick.

Wednesday we used a learning AI.


Both of these have issues. They can be better. For this challenge we have 2 goals.

* You will implement your own picking AI bot using your own design.
* Battle the 3 days of bots to get data to form a conclusion.

## Your AI:

Develop your own AI. Try not to use cheats like looking at the player move and just doing a counter for it. Stick with the spirit of the match. The bot can only learn what it saw at the end of a match and does not have the perfect foresight of seeing the other player's move before it picks.


When you post your solution also post in words what your approach is. I recommend using the 4 spaces to hide this with spoilers like you would your code submissions.


## Battle:

You will gather win/tie data on 3 different setups. 

* Monday's AI (pure random) vs Wednesday's AI (learned picks) 
* Monday's AI (pure random) vs Friday's AI (today's AI)
* Wednesday's AI vs Friday's AI.

For each of this match up of bot vs bot you will run 10,000 games. You will gather the win rate of each bot in the match ups over these 10,000 games and the tie rate.

The conclusion we are trying to reach from this data is 2 things.

* Which AI seems to be performing the best for Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock.
* How is the tie rate trending. Does it seem low, high or up and down? Per this [Video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iapcKVn7DdY) the Character Dr. Sheldon suggests that Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is better due to reduce chance of ties because of the more outcomes from a typical Rock Paper Scissor game.

#Input:

Need a way to pick the various bot match ups and have your program run 10,000 games and print out the results. The last 2 challenges set it up so this should be fairly easy to do.


#Output:


You will generate stats on the 3 match ups and then draw your conclusion on the data. What AI is the best and how is the ties trending.


#Extra Challenge:

Collaborate with other dailyprogrammers and find a way to have your AIs face off against each other.
