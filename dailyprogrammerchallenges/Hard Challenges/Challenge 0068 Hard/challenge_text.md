Implement a program you can use to play the classic game of chess. White and black alternate inputting their moves using some form of [chess notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_notation). The computer checks if the moves are legal and if so, executes them. The program should be able to tell whenever a player is in check or check-mate. You can represent the chessboard in the terminal in ascii form.

Bonus: implement a simple AI that can play chess against you.
