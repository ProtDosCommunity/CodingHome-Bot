#Description

After a failed genetic engineering experiment a lot of dinosaurs escaped into the lab, devouring most of the staff. Jeff, a scientist that worked on the project, managed to survive by hiding in the southwest corner of the rectangular lab. Now that all dinosaurs are asleep, he tries to leave the lab.

The exit of the lab is located at its northeast corner. Jeff knows that if any of the
dinosaurs wakes up, he does not stand a chance. Thus, he wants to follow a path that maximizes the minimum distance from him to the dinosaurs along the path. The length of the path is of no interest to him.

In this problem we assume that Jeff and the dinosaurs are points on the plane and that Jeff’s path is a continuous curve connecting the southwest and northeast corners of the lab. As we mentioned, Jeff wants to maximize the minimum distance between this curve and the position of any dinosaur. You can find an example solution for the third test case
in the sample input [here](http://imgur.com/duotSll).

# Formal Inputs & Outputs

## Input Description

The input contains several test cases, each consisting of several lines. The first line of
each test case contains three integers `N`, `W`, and `H` separated by single spaces. The value `N` is the number of dinosaurs in the lab. The values `W` (width)
and `H` (height) are the size of the lab. Jeff starts at `(0, 0)`, while the exit of the
lab is located at `(W, H)`.

Each of the next `N` lines contains two integers `X` and `Y` separated by a single space, representing the coordinates of a dinosaur (`1 ≤ X ≤ W − 1, 1 ≤ Y ≤ H − 1`). Note that no dinosaur is located on the border of the lab.

## Output Description

For each test case print a single line with the maximum possible distance to the
closest dinosaur rounded to three decimal digits.

# Notes/Hints

  - Here is a somewhat larger example (it is still quite small): [Input](http://pastebin.com/gpwsTWg0),
[Output](http://pastebin.com/y3siBQvC) that I need ~0.2s for. 

  - I [visualized](http://www.scribd.com/doc/236927238) all of the given samples if it helps you debug. (Best download the pdf and do not use the raster images.)

  - My best solution takes `O(N^2*log(W+H))` time and `O(N)` space in the worst case. I don't know whether there is a better solution.
