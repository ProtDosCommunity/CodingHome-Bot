What's the longest valid [word ladder](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/149kec/1242012_challenge_114_easy_word_ladder_steps/) you can make using [this list of 3,807 four-letter words](http://pastebin.com/zY4Xt7iB) without repeating any words? (Normally a word ladder would require you to take the shortest possible path between two words, but obviously you don't do that here.)

[Here's a ladder I found of 1,709 words](http://pastebin.com/DgeX0CTC). What's the best you can do? Also post the code you used to generate it, of course.
