A magic square is a square of size NxN with the numbers 1 through n^2 put in so that all rows, all columns and both diagonals sum to the same number. For instance, this is a 3x3 magic square:

    8 1 6
    3 5 7   
    4 9 2

As you can see all rows, all columns and both diagonals (8+5+2 and 4+5+6) sum to the same number, 15.

Write a program that draws a magic square of size 18x18.
