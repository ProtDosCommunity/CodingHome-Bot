# Description

> The motivation for these variants is to make the game simpler and shorter than the standard chess.

The objective is to count the number of legal positions on a [4x4 chess board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minichess).

For the purposes of this challenge, use the 'Silverman 4x4' layout provided in the link above. This means 1 row of pawns per color, 2 rooks per color, 1 queen per color, and 1 king per color.

# Input (Bonus only)

There will only be input for the bonus challenge, where you can choose the dimensions of the board.

# Output

Print the number of ways of placing chess pieces on a 4x4 board such that:

1. Both kings must be on the board (and there can only be one of each color).
2. Not both kings can be in check.
3. ~~Pawns may only occupy the first two ranks of their respective sides.~~

# Bonus

Extend your solution to accommodate different boards. Can your program handle 3x4, 4x3 or 4x4 boards? See the wikipedia article below for layouts.

# Information

There is a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minichess) on minichess variants.

Thanks to /u/mn-haskell-guy for the idea for this challenge.

Please feel free to provide feedback. I'm a decent chess player myself, however I have never played mini-chess and am not 100% versed in its rules and variations. 

# Edit

Grammar and links. I have limited the parameters of this challenge from the original posting, because as /u/J354 rightly pointed out, the original problem is being pursued by professionals and may have over a quadrillion possible solutions.
