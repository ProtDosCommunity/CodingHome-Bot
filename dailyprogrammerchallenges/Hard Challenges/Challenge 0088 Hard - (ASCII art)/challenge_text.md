Write a program that given an image file, produces an ASCII-art version of that image. Try it out on [Snoo](http://i.imgur.com/tJmB9.png) (note that the background is transparent, not white). There's no requirement that the ASCII-art be particularly good, it only needs to be good enough so that you recognize the original image in there.
