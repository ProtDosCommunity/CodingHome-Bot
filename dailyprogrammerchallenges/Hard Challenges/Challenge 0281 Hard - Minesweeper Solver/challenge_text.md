#Description

In this challenge you will come up with an algorithm to solve the classic game of [Minesweeper](http://minesweeperonline.com/).
The brute force approach is impractical since the search space size is anywhere around 10^20 to 10^100 depending on the situation, you'll have to come up with something clever.

#Formal Inputs & Outputs

##Input description

The current field state where each character represents one field. Flags will not be used. 
Hidden/unknown fields are denoted with a '?'.   
'Zero-fields' with no mines around are denoted with a space.

Example for a 9x9 board:

        1????
        1????
        111??
          1??
    1211  1??
    ???21 1??
    ????211??
    ?????????
    ?????????

##Output description

A list of zero-based row and column coordinates for the fields that you have determined to be **SAFE**. For the above input example this would be:

    0 5
    1 6
    1 7
    2 7
    3 7
    5 1
    5 7
    6 2
    6 7

The list does not need to be ordered.


#Notes/Hints

If you have no idea where to start I suggest you play the game for a while and try to formalize your strategy.

Minesweeper is a game of both logic and luck. [Sometimes it is impossible](http://i.imgur.com/yLhxzrl.jpg) to find free fields through logic. The right output would then be an empty list. Your algorithm does not need to guess.

#Bonus

Extra hard mode: Make a closed-loop bot. It should take a screenshot, parse the board state from the pixels, run the algorithm and manipulate the cursor to execute the clicks.

*Note: If this idea is selected for submission I'll be able to provide lots of input/output examples using my own solution.*

#Finally

Have a good challenge idea like /u/janismac did?
