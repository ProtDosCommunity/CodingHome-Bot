Write a function that tests whether large numbers are prime or not, with extremely high certainty. There are several primality tests that can do this. Fairly simple ones include the [Fermat Test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_primality_test) and the even better   [Miller-Rabin test.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test)  The Wikipedia articles have pseudocode you can implement.

Use your function and a random number generator to post a 100-digit prime. You can [test your result at Wolfram|Alpha.](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=factor+3413620168870555693820518760938238015371255549104140276735527985110834446323816207929693506740255567)
