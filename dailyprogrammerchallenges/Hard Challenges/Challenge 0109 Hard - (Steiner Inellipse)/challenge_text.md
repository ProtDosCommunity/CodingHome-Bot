For the difficult challenge, you must find the [Steiner Inellipse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_inellipse) of a triangle.  The Steiner Inellipse is the ellipse within a triangle that has the maximum area, without exceeding the bounds of the triangle.

For example: [here is an image of a typical inellipse.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Steiner_Inellipse.svg/250px-Steiner_Inellipse.svg.png)

For your input, you will be given the three coordinates of a triangle.  They are:

* Coord 1: (0,2)
* Coord 2: (0,7)
* Coord 3: (7,0)

For your output, you have two options: either use some sort of graphical implementation to draw the found ellipse, or output the equation of that elipse.

Good luck, and have fun!
