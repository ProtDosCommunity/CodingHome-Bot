#Description:

We all enjoy strings. We all enjoy breaking up texts. Time to go bigger than just a few sentences.

Out of curiosity we will be breaking down a movie script. The movie I have picked is Monty Python and the Holy Grail. 

So what do you mean by breaking it down? Our challenge is to crunch some numbers on this movie and figure out some fun statistics.

You will first go get the text of this script off the web. Part of the challenge is how to deal with this.

I really like this [Monty Python and the Holy Grail Script] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/mphg/mphg.htm) script of the movie.

#By Scene:

* By Scene (From 1 to 36 in order) - how many words are spoken. (Anything between [] and () are not spoken words)
* Top 3 Spoken Words (and how many times they were used) and percentage of all the words spoken in that scene.
* List of all characters in the scene and next to them How many "Lines" and "Words" they used.
* The list of characters in scene should be sorted based on count of "Words" used from high to low in count.
* A "Line" is any sentence that ends with your typical end of sentence punctuation.
* Anything in [] or () we will call a "stage direction" Just count how many directions are given. Note: Words in a stage direction do not count towards words spoken or used in script.

#By Whole Movie:

At the end of the crunch we want this data.

* Number of Lines
* Number of Words
* Number of Stage Directions
* Number of characters
* Sorted by most words the list of all Characters and how many Words and Lines they each got - Please also add a percentage of total. So if a character spoke 100/1000 lines they will have Lines 100 (10%)
* Top 10 Words sorted in Order from Most to least (Ties count as 1 Spot so if the top 2 words are "The" and "A" then it should be like 1) "The" "A"
* Top 3 Scenes with the most Words spoken (Again if ties - both are listed as 1 spot)

* In the movie there are a bunch of characters known as the Knights of Ni. They cannot say the word "it" (forbidden) - Count how many times this forbidden word is used and list a count of "Forbidden Word of the Knights of Ni"

#Output: 

Given the above you will have to format and display the data. I leave the design up to you. But it should be easy to read and understand. 

#Extra Challenge:

Find a way to show this data more meaningful than just list of hard data. Develop a Histogram or format the data into a format that makes a cool looking pie chart/table/graph.
