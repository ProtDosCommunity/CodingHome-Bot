#Description:

The [Oregon Trail] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(video_game\)) is a very iconic game. Essentially it is a road trip going from a start location to an end location. You must manage and overcome various challenges and obstacles. The game was intended for education to teach about the life of a pioneer in North America in the 19th century.

For this Friday Hard challenge you will make your own road trip game. To allow freedom for creativity I will not be placing too many narrow requirements on you for this challenge. The difficulty of this challenge is design and implementation.

Your game must meet the following requirements:

* It must involve travel. You are going from a starting point to an end point. Maybe you complete the journey. Probably most often you do not.

* It must have a scoring system. The better the score the better you do.

* It must involve at least 1 resource in limited supply that must be managed.


A quick note on the resource. The Oregon trail has several resources like food, arrows, parts for the wagon to fix it and so on. It gives a way to gain/use/lose these resources. Without the proper amount you fail your journey. The resources should fit your game's theme. If you do it in space, fuel for a spacecraft. If you are on a boat, you need tar to fix holes or cloth to repair sails. Etc.

#Input:

Up to you how you manage the game. Part of this being hard is the design falls on you.

#Output:

Text/Graphics/Other - up to you. Ideally you need an interface that a human can use and it should have some minor appeal/ease of use.
