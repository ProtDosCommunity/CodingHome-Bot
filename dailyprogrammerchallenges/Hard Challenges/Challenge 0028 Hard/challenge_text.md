The idea is simple. Use the [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/login.php?ref=L2FwaQ==) API (wrappers should not be allowed) in the most creative way to create a cool command line tool. A simple example that's very easy to implement in most modern programming languages is a program that posts to pastebin the contents of a given file. A few ideas for extra features:

* The ability to post a whole directory to pastebin with one command.
* The option to post only a part of a file
* Tweeting the link to twitter when posting
* Language recognition for the filename
* A history of recent pastes with their links
* Automatic pasting every few minutes (or after a file changes) for backup
