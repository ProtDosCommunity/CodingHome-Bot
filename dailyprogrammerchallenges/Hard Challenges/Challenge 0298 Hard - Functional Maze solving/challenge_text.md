There will be a part 2 challenge based on bonus.  I am sure we have done maze solving before, but its been a while, and challenge is mainly about the bonus.

Borrowing from adventofcode.com, http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/24, solve the following maze returning the path (length) visiting nodes labelled 1 to 7 starting from 0.  `#` are walls.  May not travel diagonally.  Correct answer for path length with this input is `460`

This is a fairly large maze, and you may wish to resort to one of the main graph algorithms that minimize how often a node cost is calculated.  Namely [Astar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)... though there are other options.

#bonus

For the bonus, the requirement is to use higher order functions for your algorithm.  The "end function" should be one with the simplest interface:

searchfunction(start, goal, mazeORgraph)

called to solve paths from 0 to 1, would be called with searchfunction(0,1,abovemaze)

You might handcraft this function to solve the problem without the bonus.

To build this function functionally, inputs to the [higher order function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) include: 

* transform start and goal into internal states (for this problem likely 2d indexes of where each position is located)
* test when the goal state is reached
* determine the valid neighbours of a node (in this example, excludes walls.  May exclude previously visited nodes)
* Calculation for distance travelled so far (may be linked list walking or retrieving a cached number)
* Scoring function (often called heuristic in Astar terminology) to select the most promising node(s) to investigate further.  For this type of maze, manhattan distance.
* Other parameters relevant to your algorithm.

Your higher order function might transform the functional inputs to fit with/bind internal state structures.

The general idea behind this higher order functional approach is that it might work with completely different reference inputs than a start and goal symbol, and a 2d map/maze.  Part 2 will request just that.

# bonus #2

Enhance the functional approach with for example:

* default functional parameters, where perhaps all of functions used to solve a 2d maze, are the defaults if no functions are provided to the higher order function.

* a dsl, that makes multi-function input easier.

# P.S.

Unfortunately, there may not be any other challenges this week.  Other than part 2 of this challenge on Friday.
