#Description

He's at it again, the professor at the department of Computer Science has posed a question to all his students knowing that they can't brute-force it. He wants them all to think about the efficiency of their algorithms and how they could possibly reduce the execution time.

He posed the problem to his students and then smugly left the room in the mindset that none of his students would complete the task on time (maybe because the program would still be running!).

#The problem

What is the 1000000th number that is not divisble by any prime greater than 20?

#NOTE 

counting will start from 1. Meaning that the 1000000th number is the 1000000th number and not the 999999th number.
