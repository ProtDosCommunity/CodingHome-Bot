Using the data-structure described in [today's intermediate problem](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/wa10w/792012_challenge_74_intermediate/), [follow Knuth's paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0011047) and make a complete implementation of Dancing Links that is able to solve exact cover problems.

Bonus: make a Sudoku solver using your implemented algorithm. If you need help converting Sudoku into an exact cover problem, see this [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover#Sudoku).
