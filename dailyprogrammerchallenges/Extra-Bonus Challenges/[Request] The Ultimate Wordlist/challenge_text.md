So quite often, there are challenges that will involve manipulating a large list of words. For this we usually use one of several txt files that are available on the web.

There has been a short discussion on the latest [intermediate challenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2nihz6/20141126_challenge_190_intermediate_words_inside/cmdw2ux) about consolidating all of these lists into one file to rule them all.

If you can reply in the comments with a name and link to your wordlist that would be appreciated. Then we can get the ball rolling on having a standard wordlist to use.

There are 3 that I know of (I only possess enable and Wordlist)

* Unix wordlist
* enable1.txt
* Wordlist.txt (bit vague, but that's what I know it as)

If you have any other wordlists, do the honour of posting them and maybe someone can whip up a script to mash them all into one file.

Thanks :D !

#Someone's done it before

Thanks to /u/I_ASK_DUMB_SHIT for showing us the mega wordlist. 15gb and it claims to have every major wordlist in its contents

#Finally

Since we've had that crackstation submission, it makes sense to remove this from the sticky. But for now, I'll keep it up as I've seen a few interesting other wordlists that wouldn't be in a conventional one (pokemon, flowers, planet names etc...)
