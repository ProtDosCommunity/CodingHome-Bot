#Weekly Topic #1

Often part of the challenges is getting the data into memory to solve the problem. A very easy way to handle it is hard code the challenge data. Another way is read from a file.


For this week lets look at reading from a console. The user entered input. How do you go about it? Posting examples of languages and what your approach is to handling this. I would suggest start a thread on a language. And posting off that language comment.


Some key points to keep in mind.

* There are many ways to do things.
* Keep an open mind
* The key with this week topic is sharing insight/strategy to using console input in solutions.

#Suggested Input to handle:

Lets read in strings. we will give n the number of strings then the strings.

##Example:

     5
     Huey
     Dewey
     Louie
     Donald
     Scrooge
