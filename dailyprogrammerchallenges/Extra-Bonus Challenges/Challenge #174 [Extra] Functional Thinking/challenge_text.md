# *(Extra)*: Functional Thinking

I'm trying a new bonus challenge today with any theme I can think of, such as rewriting an existing solution using a different paradigm or with a limitation on how you can write it. I'm going to see how this is received and may or may not make this a recurring thing. I will be writing these to primarily be a learning exercise - both for me and for you, the readers of /r/DailyProgrammer - so if you are interested in learning about new languages, new ways of writing solutions or modern programming in general then this may be of interest for you. For today, though, you are to rewrite a solution (that you've wrote) to *any* previous challenge (and as many as you want to), in a functional programming language.

If you're new to functional programming languages, like I am, it's a paradigm of programming that treats a program as an evaluation of functions only, avoiding variables. Everything is treated as a function, and programs written in such a language are designed and look substantially different to one written in an imperative language such as Python, Java or Ruby. There are a boat load of languages you can choose from. One of the popular ones on /r/DailyProgrammer is [Haskell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29). There is the Lisp family (including [Common Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp), [Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language) and [Clojure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure)). [R](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29) is also debatably a functional language, or at least can be used as one. There are others too. Pick one you like and rewrite one of your existing solutions in it. Do you use Haskell or something already? Rewrite it in a new functional language! They're all different in some way or another.

I'm trying to learn Clojure at the moment myself so I'll be submitting some of my own solutions.
