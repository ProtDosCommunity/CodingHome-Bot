Code poetry is the act of producing code that reads like poetry. Here are a few examples from some finalists in a code poetry competition;

#Examples

    include everything.*;
    void wonder(Universe u) {
      while (ever || never) {
        for (Poem i in u.now()) {
          Word dust = u.speak(i);
          for (Moment mote in dust) {
            wonder(new Universe(mote));
          }
        }
      }
    }

--

    import java.Object.*

    public class ThatGirl {
      public SomethingBetter main() {
        return whatYouFound;
      }
    }

#Challenge

Your task is to construct your own poem. The more of the language you use to create your poem rather than creating your own named functions and classes, the better. The actual algorithms you create are not important, it does not have to be technical code. You can add two integers together and try and make it poetic if you want.


#Rules

To make sure everyone is on a level field

* No comments

* No SQL - Way too easy.

* No redefining keywords - You must use the syntax available to you. You can still create classes and functions.

* No print statements.

* Like I said previously, the code does not have to be technical. It can be any problem you desire no matter how easy.

* Symbols like '=','+','{' etc... are not pronounced.

* The program must run!


#Bonus

Create a code Haiku (5,7,5 ). Every word counts towards the syllable count, including words like 'include','public','var' etc... (symbols still do not count)
