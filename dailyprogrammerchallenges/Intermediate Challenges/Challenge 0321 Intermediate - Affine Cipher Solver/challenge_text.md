#Description

You are to output what you think is the solution to a given [Affine Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_cipher). In short, Affine ciphers are encoded by the following formula for each character in the plaintext: `C ≡ aP + b (mod 26)` where `a` and `b` are constants, `C` is the ciphertext letter, and `P` is the plaintext letter. In this case, the letter "a" has the value of 0, "b" 1, and so on and so forth. If you want a hint as to how to decode:

    Decoding is done in the same fashion as encoding: P ≡ aC + b

In order to rank your decodings in terms of accuracy, I recommend you use a dictionary of some sort (builtin, or the popular [enable1.txt](http://norvig.com/ngrams/enable1.txt) -- note that enable1 lacks "i" and "a" as words). You can choose to not use a dictionary, but it will likely be harder.

Here's a sample of encoding, done with simple numbers (`a = 3, b = 2`) **N.B. This is done with the letters a-z mapped to 1-26 (26≡0) instead of 0-25. This still is correct, just not the exact result you'd expect from following the method I've established previously.**

`foobar`

First, we express our input numerically

`6, 15, 15, 2, 0, 18`

Then we multiply by `a`

`18, 45, 45, 12, 0, 54`

Optionally reduce to least positive residue

`18, 19, 19, 12, 0, 2`

Add `b`

`20, 21, 21, 18, 2, 4`

Now we change this to text again

`tyyrbd`

#Formal Inputs & Outputs

##Input description

Input will be words separated by spaces or newlines. Input will be in uppercase if need be (i.e. if you can't figure out a way to handle mixed cases), but if not, it will be provided in regular text (e.g. `Lorum ipsum ... word`). Expect only alphabetical characters. With reference to my previous equation, `a` will *only* be a number coprime with 26. Hint:

    that is, a will be one of the following: 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, or 25


##Output description

What your program thinks is the correct decoding, in lowercase if you only took uppercase input, else in the same case as you were given. You may give multiple outputs if there is a "tie" in your scoring, that is, if your program deemed two or more decodings to be correct.


#Test Cases

**Test Case 1:** NLWC WC M NECN

    this is a test

**Test Case 2:** YEQ LKCV BDK XCGK EZ BDK UEXLVM QPLQGWSKMB

    you lead the race of the worlds unluckiest

**Test Case 2 Bonus:** Yeq lkcv bdk xcgk ez bdk uexlv'm qplqgwskmb.

    You lead the race of the world's unluckiest.

    my heart aches and a drowsy numbness pains my sense as though of hemlock i had drunk or emptied some dull opiate to the drains one minute past and lethe wards had sunk

    My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains / My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk, / Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains / One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk.

#Bonus

Make your solver work for all forms of input, not just alphabetical and make your output match the input. I think it goes without saying that this challenge is for the English language, but if you want to, make this program for another language or compatible with English and another. If you want another challenge, optimize your code for run-time (I'd be interested to see submissions in this category).
