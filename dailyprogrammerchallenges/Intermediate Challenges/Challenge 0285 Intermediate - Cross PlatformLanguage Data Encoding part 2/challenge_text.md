The goal of this challenge is to encode and decode records in a compact and/or efficient self contained manner.  Because the more I type, the more confusing the challenge is interpreted, I will avoid discussing process as much as I can.

# 1. fixed length records: birthdays

Database systems prefer tables of fixed length records because it is easy and fast to retrieve any single record that way.

A customer birthday is:

* A tuple of Year, Month, Day
* The year is in the past, and can be assumed to not be earlier than 1900

So the year, month, day can be stored as 1 byte each, and this arrangement makes it easiest to search on year or other components.  (the year can be coded as the offset to 1900)


**challenge** (encode following dates)

1944/11/22  
1982/3/14  
1986/2/11  

#2. add a header to the file

Database management software needs to know what is in the file.  Create a strategy to describe what is in the file, such that it can be read and written to.

Information to include in the header:

* Fixed vs variable sized records (above is fixed)
* code to unpack into native format
* code to pack from native into file format
* method to tell where header ends and data begins.

TIP: An easy way to provide language agnostic packing code is to provide a minimum and maximum allowed range to integer (or float for that matter) data.

# 3. variable length fields/records

A subject touched upon in Monday's part 1 challenge, was that there are 2 general strategies to coding the field length of variable length data with the data.  There are in fact 3 strategies:

1. interleave length with data elements.  Disadvantage is that file must be read sequentially to retrieve any element.
2. place a key of lengths or (easily derived) offsets to data starts as a header element to the data.  Relatively fast specific data access.  More memory used.  2 updates needed when record/field changed.
3. Use a seperator, non-legal-data-value.  Still sequential read disadvantage, but a faster sequential read.  Requires that a non-legal-data value or escape sequence exists.


FYI, most database (and in memory) systems allocate variable string data by using a "too big" text field and left aligning data within the larger space.  Provides quickest indexed access and in place updates. 

**challenge for 3 fields:  FirstName LastName DateOfBirth**:

Bill Gates 1947/1/14  
Mark Zuckerberg 1987/11/4  
Steve Jobs 1955/3/7

Where firstname and lastname are variable length fields.  Can use whatever strategy you wish, but include a header that self describes how to unpack the data into native memory.

# 4. Multiple variable file

Variation to number 3 (and may do one or the other), instead of encoding a table as a single variable, encode the data as 3 variables which are each lists of 3 items.  This is known as an inverted table or column-oriented database.

The 3 variables correspond to FirstName, LastName, DateofBirth
