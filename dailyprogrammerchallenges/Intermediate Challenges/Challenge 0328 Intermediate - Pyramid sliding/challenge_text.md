#Description

Pyramid sliding is a fun sport, but you have to be fast or you'll get burned

In this challenge you have to find the quickest path down the pyramid

A pyramid is represented as such:

       1
      2 3
     4 5 6

Where you always start from the top and have to find your way to the bottom

You can only slide downwards and you can only slide to the 2 adjecent field downward

fx 1 -> [2, 3], 2 -> [4, 5] and 3 -> [5, 6] as their only possible moves

#Input description

Input will have an *N* telling how many layers the pyramid is made of

afterward there will be *N* arrays given, each 1 longer than the previous

The first array is always of size 1

fx:

    4
    1
    2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9 10

#Output description

Output is simply the sum of the shortest path down

from previous example this would be:

    14

from the path 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 7

#Hint
The 2 possible moves from a position in a layer to the one below it is:

pyramid[i + 1][j] 

pyramid[i + 1][j + 1]
