#Description

We want to return home, but we have to go trough an [arrow maze](http://imgur.com/TjYhSB4).

We start at [a certain point](http://imgur.com/QTxERGr) an in a arrow maze you can only follow [the direction of the arrow](http://imgur.com/a097dDJ).

At each node in the maze we can decide to change direction (depending on the new node) or follow the direction we where going.

When done right, we should have a path to [home](http://imgur.com/UqD5Brf) 

#Formal Inputs & Outputs
