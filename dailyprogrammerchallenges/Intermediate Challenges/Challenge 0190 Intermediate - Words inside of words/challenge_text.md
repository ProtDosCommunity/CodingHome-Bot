#Description

This weeks challenge is a short yet interesting one that should hopefully help you exercise elegant solutions to a problem rather than bruteforcing a challenge.

#Challenge

Given the wordlist [enable1.txt](http://www.joereynoldsaudio.com/enable1.txt), you must find the word in that file which also contains the greatest number of words within that word.

For example, the word 'grayson' has the following words in it

Grayson

Gray

Grays

Ray

Rays

Son

On


Here's another example, the word 'reports' has the following

reports

report

port

ports

rep




You're tasked with finding the word in that file that contains the most words.

NOTE : If you have a different wordlist you would like to use, you're free to do so.

#Restrictions

* To keep output slightly shorter, a word will only be considered a word if it is 2 or more letters in length

* The word you are using may not be permuted to get a different set of words (You can't change 'report' to 'repotr' so that you can add more words to your list)


#Finally
