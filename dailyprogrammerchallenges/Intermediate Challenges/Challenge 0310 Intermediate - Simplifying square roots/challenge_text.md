#Description
Simplify square roots in the form `(a sqrt(b))/(c sqrt(d))`. A simplified radical should have no square roots in the denominator and no number in a square root should have a square factor. For example, the input `2 5 5 10` for `a b c d`, respectively, should simplify to `1 2 5` where a=1, b=2, and c=5.

#Output description
 
     a b c 

(d should not exist after simplifying)
