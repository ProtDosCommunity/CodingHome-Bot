# Description


Cribbage is a game played with a standard deck of 52 cards. There are several phases or rounds to playing cribbage: deal, discard, play and show. Players can earn points during the play and show rounds. This challenge is specific to the **show** phase of gameplay only. Each player's hand consists of 4 cards and an additional face up card.

* Any number of cards that add up to 15 (regardless of suit) – 2 points
* Runs of 3, 4, or 5 cards – 3, 4 and 5 points respectively 
* Pairs: 2, 3, or 4 of a kind – 2, 6 and 12 points respectively
* Flushes: 4 or 5 cards of the same suit (note, the additional face up card is not counted for a 4 card flush) – 4 and 5 points respectively

Note: cards can be used more than once, for each combo
