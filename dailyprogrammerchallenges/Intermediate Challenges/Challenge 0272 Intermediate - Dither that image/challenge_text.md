# Description

[Dithering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither) is the intentional use of
noise to reduce the error of compression. If you start with a color image
and want to reduce it to two colors (black and white) the naive approach is
to threshold the image. However, the results are usually terrible.

One of the most popular dithering algorithms is
[Floyd-Steinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering).
When a pixel is thresholded, the error (difference) between the original value
and the converted value is carried forward into nearby pixels.

There are other approaches, such as
[Ordered Dithering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering) with a
Bayer Matrix.

# Input

Your program will take a color or grayscale image as its input. You may choose
your input method appropriate to your language of choice. If you want to do it
yourself, I suggest picking a [Netpbm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm)
format, which is easy to read.

# Output

Output a two-color (e.g. Black and White) dithered image in your choice of
format. Again, I suggest picking a Netpbm format, which is easy to write.
