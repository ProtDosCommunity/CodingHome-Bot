#Description

You're lonely and bored. Your doritos are stale and no one is online, this loneliness you feel has a cure...A TAMAGOTCHI


For those of you who have never heard of a Tamagotchi, here's a quick summary:


A tamagotchi is a virtual pet whose life you must sustain through various activities including eating, playing, making it sleep, and cleaning its poop. Tamagotchi's go through several life cycles, most notably, egg/infant, teen, adult, elderly. Tamagotchi's can die from lack of attention (in the classic ones, half a day of neglect would kill it) and also from age.

Your job is to create a tamagotchi via command line, gui or any other avenue you'd like.


#Requirements

The tamagotchi must have at **least** the following requirements:

* Capable of being fed
* Capable of being put to bed
* Capable of going to sleep on its own, losing health from hunger and pooping on its own without prompting
* Capable of aging from birth through to death

Like I said, these are the bare minimum requirements, feel free to get quirky and add weird stuff like diseases and love interests.
