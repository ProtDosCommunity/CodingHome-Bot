#Description

Morse code is an aural method of transmitting text through the use of silence and tones.

Todays challenge will involve translating your standard english text into morse code, and from there, into an audio file.

##Example

Step 1: "I like cats" - The phrase entered by you for translating


Step 2: .. / .-.. .. -.- . / -.-. .- - ... - The output of the phrase in step 1


Step 3: cats.wav - An audio file containing each dot(.) and dash(-) as an audible tone


#Formal Inputs & Outputs


##Input description



On standard console input, you should enter a phrase of your choosing. This will then be parsed into morse code and finally outputted as stated in the output description.



##Output description


The program should output a valid audio file (WAV, MP3, OGG, as long as it can play it's fine). In that audio should be an audio translation of your input.
