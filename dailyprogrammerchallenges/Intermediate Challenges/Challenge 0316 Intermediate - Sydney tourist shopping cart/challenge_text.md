# Description

This challenge is to build a tourist booking engine where customers can book tours and activities around the Sydney.
Specially, you're task today is to build the shopping cart system. We will start with the following tours in our database.

| Id | Name | Price |
|:---|------|-------|
| OH | Opera house tour | $300.00 |
| BC | Sydney Bridge Climb | $110.00 |
| SK | Sydney Sky Tower | $30.00 | 

As we want to attract attention, we intend to have a few weekly specials.

* We are going to have a 3 for 2 deal on opera house ticket. For example, if you buy 3 tickets, you will pay the price of 2 only getting another one completely free of charge.
* We are going to give a free Sky Tower tour for with every Opera House tour sold
* The Sydney Bridge Climb will have a bulk discount applied, where the price will drop $20, if someone buys more than 4

These promotional rules have to be as flexible as possible as they will change in the future. Items can be added in any order.

An object oriented interface could look like:

    ShoppingCart sp = new ShopingCart(promotionalRules); 
    sp.add(tour1);
    sp.add(tour2);
    sp.total();

Your task is to implement the shopping cart system described above. You'll have to figure out the `promotionalRules` structure, for example. 

# Input Description 

You'll be given an order, one order per line, using the IDs above. Example:

    OH OH OH BC
    OH SK
    BC BC BC BC BC OH

# Output Description

Using the weekly specials described above, your program should emit the total price for the tour group. Example:

    Items                 Total
    OH, OH, OH, BC  =  710.00
    OH, SK  = 300.00
    BC, BC, BC, BC, BC, OH = 750
