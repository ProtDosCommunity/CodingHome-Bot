Write a function that, given a string, removes from the string any `*` character, or any character that's one to the left or one to the right of a `*` character. Examples:

`"adf*lp" --> "adp"`  
`"a*o" --> ""`  
`"*dech*" --> "ec"`  
`"de**po" --> "do"`  
`"sa*n*ti" --> "si"`  
`"abc" --> "abc"`
