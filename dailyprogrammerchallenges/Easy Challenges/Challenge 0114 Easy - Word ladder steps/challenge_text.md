A word ladder is a sequence of words made by changing one letter at a time. For example:
`cold → cord → card → ward → warm`
Given a word, list all the words that can appear next to it in a word ladder, using [this list of 3,807 four-letter words][link1]. Sample input:
```
puma
```
Sample output:

```
duma
pima
puja
pula
pump
puna
pupa
```
How many words from the list can appear next to the word `best` in a word ladder?

**Bonus 1:** One word in the list has 33 other words that can appear next to it. What is this word?

**Bonus 2:** How many different words can be reached, starting from best, in 3 or fewer steps?
